        <p>To avoid clutter and error-free content it is advisable to write a rough draft of the introduction at the beginning of your dissertation so that it will help and guide you in your research work. But make sure to write a rough draft only because sometimes when proofreading the whole dissertation there is a need to edit the introduction chapter to make it comply with other chapters. You can use a rough draft as a template as it consists of many of the same elements. But keep reviewing the introduction section throughout the writing process, and also ensure that it must match the content of each chapter.
