        <h4> Writing a dissertation abstract-A Concise Summary of Overall Research</h4>
        Students would sometimes come across to rethink while writing a dissertation abstract for their dissertation as the most influential parts of your dissertation are going to end up in your abstract. When done rightly and concisely, it must present an outline of your entire work and engage the audience to read the entire dissertation. Whenever students are conducting detailed scientific research, there is a requirement to summarise the entire study, methodologies applied, the background of the study, as well as outcome of the research. This whole summary is known as the “Abstract”. It is considered to be the crux of the whole research which lets readers know precisely what the research is about and its outcomes.
        Without a broad content abstract, it's hardly possible for readers to find the uniqueness of your research. In this sense, a good abstract is must comprised of two purposes: <span className='fw-bolder'>to well aware of the potential readers of your research, and to inform research databases about your dissertation in the particular field of science.</span> Also, there are no constraints on word count and proportions of the abstract, though usually an abstract is 150-250 words long or it can be above and below the word count depending upon the requirement.
        <br />
        <br />
        
        Well-written and precise abstract contains the below elements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            A brief statement of the problem discussed that are investigating or going to conduct, including why research on this topic is required
          </li>
          <li>
            Research methods applied
          </li>
          <li>
            Main findings
          </li>
          <li>
            The suggestions and conclusions
          </li>
        </ul>
        An abstract of a dissertation appears after the title page and acknowledgments. A professional abstract should be written concisely with one paragraph that is not more than 1 page. It's best to check with the department before starting as various institutions have different guidelines for writing an abstract for a dissertation proposal. It gives an overall view of what you have done in your dissertation, for this you should keep the balance between too much information and not too enough so that your audience would be able to view the abstract and get an overall idea of your entire findings.
       <br />
       <br />
      
       <b> Following are the guidelines that should be kept in mind when writing the perfect abstract:</b><br />
       <br />
        
          <ol>
            <li>
              Does the focus of my study and findings identified?
            </li>
            <li>
              Did I showcase my rationale behind the study?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do I carry out my research proof?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do I present a summary of actual findings?
            </li>
            <li>
              Do I provide suggestions and conclusions?
            </li>
          </ol>
          In some circumstances, there is a need to include keywords also. To include keywords, make sure that keywords are specifically relevant to the research. Also, there's a need to avoid too many acronyms in the abstract because the abstract needs to be reviewed by a wider audience, so making it easy to understand this wider number of audiences is necessary to your research success.
          Ultimately, when writing a well-written abstract is the same as writing a good dissertation. There is a need for a logical and organized synopsis that elaborates what your research has trying to achieve.
          Most of the students also make the necessary efforts to make sure that the project is ready for submission by applying for a review for the finished work as it is always been beneficial for an author to present his/her study in front of experts and professionals to have a fresh set of eyes that read their chapter to make sure that the author does not omit any key points and that it is free of error.

        <h4>FAQs</h4>
        <br />
        <h5>1) How many words should be in an abstract?</h5>
        It is suggested to follow the strict word count which is around 200-300 words for your abstract for a dissertation proposal or you can go above or below the word count limit as per the requirement given.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h5>2) what are the four main characteristics of a good abstract?</h5>
        One common and most frequent way used to map your research abstract is to apply the IMRaD structure, which stands for:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> Research purpose (what is it about and why it is important to include)
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Methods:</strong> Methodology used (how the research is carried out)
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Results:</strong> Key research findings (what answers to questions you have found)
          </li>
          <li>
          <strong>Discussion:</strong> The implications of the findings and results (what's the meaning of these findings)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h5>3) Do i need an introduction if i have an abstract?</h5>
        <br />
        The dissertation abstract comes before the dissertation introduction in a research paper it may seem surprising while it's not necessary to include just like an introduction but the purpose to include it, in the beginning, is that the reader should encounter your abstract in your dissertation first so it's easy for him or her to can understand the big picture of your research. It should only portray your research background information, methods and techniques utilized, and a summary of your findings and nearly around 200-300 word count. On the other hand, the introduction chapter supports background information, searchability for your published work, citations and referencing sections, details of methods, results, and conclusions, and should be 500 words or more.
