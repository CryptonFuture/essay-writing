            <li>
                <b>Rigorous Data Explanation</b><br />
                The reader of a discussion chapter must expect the data interpretation of the figures from the previous chapter. It's usual to expect this! You have to master the basic understanding of the issue as the dissertation introduction and the literature review chapter already served the purpose to help your reader understand the matter a bit better, then you present your methods and the research findings, and now there’s a high time to clarify their significance and meaning.<br />Avoid going too academic with the style. Your center of attention is normal people who should understand the clear, jargon-free tone of the chapter 5 dissertation discussion. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Describe the Practical Implications of the findings</b><br />
                While conducting research you came across some interesting findings, Good to hear! but it's a never-ending debate have you thought about their practical implementation before?

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3.	Limitations of the Findings?</b><br />
                All research findings have limitations, such as they need further research in the future that’s why no research study is final. As they come from a controlled environment and sample, you need to mention these limitations and also offer recommendations to research it further in the discussion chapter final part.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Length of a Dissertation Discussion Chapter</b><br />
                Previously if you hired a dissertation proposal writer to get a brilliant outline for the project. You were in the position to write. Great! But you felt something missing as, during the process of the research, you found a lot of amazing stuff that you want to include now.<br />We’ll suggest you don’t go overboard! Researchers and readers are busy, they will hardly get the time to read a study with 3000 or more words in a single chapter. Give them the best and avoid fillers, as there’s no precise guideline for this chapter length. But to avoid ambiguity and gain clarity, too wordy content isn’t suggested because it’s important to stick to the facts and must present them in the clearest way possible to help your readers in understanding.
