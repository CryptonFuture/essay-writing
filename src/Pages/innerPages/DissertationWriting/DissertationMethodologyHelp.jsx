        <h1>Dissertation Methodology Help</h1>
        <p>Writing a whole dissertation or individual chapters both are considered to be a hectic job for students, as it will require constant effort and time to do their job while meeting other academic requirements such as assignments, projects, and final degree exams. One of the key sections of your dissertation is the methodology chapter which comes up immediately after the completion of the literature review chapter and is the third chapter of your dissertation. The methodology is not quite the same as ‘methods’. This chapter describes the broad philosophical foundation laid by your chosen research methods, whether you're using a qualitative method or quantitative method, or a mixture of both methods, and why.</p>
        <p>To justify your statement you should have an understanding of the academic basis for all the research method choices that you already have made. Don’t use phrases like 'I was interested…' or 'I thought...' that is not enough, must provide some academic reasons for your choices to make your statement clear and free of ambiguity free</p>

        <h3>Writing a dissertation methodology</h3>
        <p>Writing a dissertation methodology is an integral part and establishes a strong and precise relationship between research questions, the existing scholarship in the area of a subject that you have already surveyed in your literature review part, and how you will come to your conclusion. Hence, there is no limit no matter what area of the subject you are working in. The methodology chapter must include the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Research question recap</b></li>
        </ul>
                <p>The key justification and demonstration for the methodology are based on and must fit the purpose to answer the research problems or research questions that you produce at the beginning of a dissertation. Focus on recapping the key vital questions that you want to answer when starting the methodology chapter, but it doesn’t mean including word-for-word restatement, just rescript the research problem in a way that creates a bridge between the literature review and methodology chapter so that your audience can find a connection between the both.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Design Description</b></li>
        </ul>
                <p>This is supposed to be the heart of the methodology chapter. In this part of your methodology chapter, you need to explain clearly your collecting and analyzing data process, or your research question approach. Be sure to make this part precise, free of ambiguity, and detailed enough so that another researcher can read it easily and can apply it in some way. Furthermore, if you offer a new theoretical take on a published work or a rational problem, your reader can easily understand your theory and apply it to another problem while if you describe a scientific experiment in your methodology, so the reader can have all through which they need in recreating your study experiment in a lab. In the case of introducing any new type of statistical model, it will aid the reader to apply the model to the data set after covering your methodology part.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Design choice background</b></li>
        </ul>
                <p>As discussed earlier that methodology possesses the most integral part of the overall dissertation because the justification of methods used in the study proved to be a foundation of research. This part of the methodology includes describing your method, your reasons for choosing it, and believing in it why it will give you the best results, conclusions, an insightful set of analyses, or an innovative perspective. It will draw the most part from the literature review chapter, your choices presenting as enlightened and rooted in sound scholarship, on the other hand ideally also display innovation and creativity. Make sure that when relating the rationale for your research method accurately to your research problem, to be adaptable to the reader it should be crystal clear so that they can easily understand that the methodology you have selected is thoughtful enough, insightful, and tailored response to the questions that you're trying to answer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Evaluation of method selection</b></li>
        </ul>
                <p>There is no perfect research method, and the one you have chosen likely comes up with some trade-offs. You may choose a small set of interviews as it is feasible to carry out and as an individual viewpoint of a set of interviewees on the existing problem that you explore is more valuable than a larger data set in responses to the same question. It clearly shows you, even so, sacrifice a quantitative method to the problem of your research that might possess its own set of valuable and important insights. While evaluating, you have to be honest not apologetic when it comes to your chosen method's limitations, and justify why it is still the best method for the research purpose other than any other approach.</p>
